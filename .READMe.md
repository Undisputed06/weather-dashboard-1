## Description 

For this project, I built a weather dashboard. I did not have any starter code, but I had a mockup to reference. The user is able to enter a city, and the current and five  day forecast is displayed. The user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index
displays a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
